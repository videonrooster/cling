- added callback interceptor to execute pre and post code around action execution:

	Action action = service.getAction("Browse");
	action.setActionCallbackInterceptor(new ActionCallbackInterceptor() {
			@Override
			public void preExecute(ActionInvocation actionInvocation) {
				log.info("before " + actionInvocation.getAction().getName());
			}

			@Override
			public void postExecute(ActionInvocation actionInvocation) {
				log.info("after " + actionInvocation.getAction().getName());
			}
		});
		
		
		
- added alternate Android implementation for SwitchableRouter, UpnpServiceConfiguration and NetworkFactory that
works with all connectivity  types (mobile, wifi, ethernet, ...)


- added SubscriptionCallback.invalidXMLException() callback to notify of invalid XML received

- ActionInvocation can be associated the User-Agent and remote address

- fix: IntegerDataType.valueOf(s) return getMaxValue() if s is "NOT_IMPLEMENTED" (some devices send this forbidden value instead of max value, as per spec)

- hack: relaxed ServiceId.valueof() for bogus value sent by PS Audio Bridge

- added UserConstants.java to override PRODUCT_TOKEN_NAME and PRODUCT_TOKEN_VERSION

- change: Namespace.CALLBACK_FILE is /cb instead /cb.xml to workaround Onkyo receiver bug that will percent encode '.'

- added Registry.setLocalDeviceAdvertising() to toggle advertising on the LAN of a local device on/off

- added PullGENAEventProcessor, RecoverGENAEventProcessor. 

The pull processor uses a XML Pull Parser and is more lenient in parsing than the default impl DOM processor

the recover processor specialize the pull processor to handle recovery of badly encoded XML. This was mainly implemented to handle LastChange SOAP events that are broken
in every possible way by manufacturers. it will try very hard to recover the most data as possible, event incomplete.

Both processor pass succesfully EventXMLProcessingTest. Furthermore RecoverGENAEventProcessor passes 
more tests in EventXMLProcessingRecoveryTest dealing with real-life broken XML samples (tests/resources/brokenxml).

- added  PullSOAPActionProcessor, RecoverSOAPActionProcessor. 

the pull processor:

- avoid to use a 800Kb replacement DOM parser on Android > 3.0 due to this bug: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=18102.
- allow action output parameters in any order (very frequent with GetProtocolInfoResponse, where Source and Sink in inverted).
- is more lenient with parsing, look only for the required XML tags

The recover processor is a specialization of the pull processor that attempts to fix XML entity encoding issues.

   
- modified SOAPActionProcessorImpl to allow action output parameters in any order
 
- NetworkAddressFactoryImpl: ignore link-local addresses

- added NetworkAddressFactory.getAddressNetworkPrefixLength()
